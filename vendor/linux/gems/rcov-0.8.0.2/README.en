rcov README
============

  rcov is a code coverage tool for Ruby. It is commonly used for viewing
  overall test coverage of target code. It features:
  * fast execution: 20-300 times faster than previous tools
  * multiple analysis modes: standard, bogo-profile, "intentional testing",
    dependency analysis...
  * detection of uncovered code introduced since the last run ("differential
    code coverage")
  * fairly accurate coverage information through code linkage inference using 
    simple heuristics
  * cross-referenced XHTML and several kinds of text reports
  * support for easy automation with Rake and Rant
  * colorblind-friendliness

Requirements
------------

  * Ruby 1.8
  * (recommended) C compiler: you can also use rcov without the rcovrt
    extension but rcov will be two orders of magnitude slower. The extension
    requires Ruby 1.8.3 or later.
    If you're on win32, you can find a pre-built rcovrt extension at
	 http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov


Normal install
--------------

  De-compress the archive and enter its top directory.
  Then type:

   ($ su)
    # ruby setup.rb

  This simple step installs rcov under the default location for Ruby
  libraries.  You can also customize the installation by supplying some
  options to setup.rb.
  Try "ruby setup.rb --help".

  A normal (rcovrt-enabled) install requires Ruby >= 1.8.3 and a working C
  toolchain; if you cannot compile Ruby extensions proceed as described below.
  
  If you're on win32, you can find a pre-built rcovrt extension at
	 http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov

  You might have to install a "development package" (often named ruby-dev or
  ruby1.8-dev), or alternatively build ruby from the sources, if the compiler
  cannot find the headers (ruby.h and friends).

Install without the rcovrt extension
------------------------------------

  ($su )
  # ruby setup.rb all --without-ext

  will install rcov without building the rcovrt extension.
  
Usage
-----

  In the common scenario, your tests are under test/ and the target code
  (whose coverage you want) is in lib/. In that case, all you have to do is
  use rcov to run the tests (instead of testrb), and a number of XHTML files
  with the code coverage information will be generated, e.g.

   rcov -Ilib test/*.rb

  will execute all the .rb files under test/ and generate the code coverage
  report for the target code (i.e. for the files in lib/) under coverage/. The
  target code needs not be under lib/; rcov will detect is as long as it is
  require()d by the tests. rcov is smart enough to ignore "uninteresting"
  files: the tests themselves, files installed in Ruby's standard locations,
  etc.  See  rcov --help  for the list of regexps rcov matches filenames
  against.
  
  rcov can also be used from Rake; see README.rake or the RDoc documentation
  for more information.  The Rakefile included in rcov's sources holds a few
  tasks that run rcov on itself, producing a number of reports. You can try
    rake rcov
  preferably after a full install or
    ruby setup.rb config
    ruby setup.rb setup
  so that the rcovrt extension can be used to speed up the process.
  This will generate a cross-referenced XHTML report under coverage/.
 
  rcov can output information in several formats, and perform different kinds
  of analyses in addition to plain code coverage.  See  rcov --help  for a
  description of the available options.
