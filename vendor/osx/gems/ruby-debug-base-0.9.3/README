= ruby-debug

== Overview

ruby-debug is a fast implementation of the standard debugger debug.rb.
The faster execution speed is achieved by utilizing a new hook Ruby C API.

== Requirements

ruby-debug requires Ruby 1.8.4 or higher.

If you are running Linux or Unix you'll need a C compiler so the extension
can be compiled when it is installed.


== Install

ruby-debug is provided as a RubyGem.  To install:

<tt>gem install ruby-debug</tt>

== Usage

There are two ways of running ruby-debug.

=== rdebug executable:

$ rdebug <your-script>

When you start your script this way, the debugger will stop at
the first line of code in the script file. So you will be able 
to set up your breakpoints.

=== ruby-debug API

The second way is to use the ruby-debug API to interrupt your
code execution at runtime.

  require 'ruby-debug'
  ...
  def your_method
    ...
    debugger
    ...
  end

When Kernel#debugger method is executed, the debugger is activated
and you will be able to inspect and step through your code.

== Performance

The debug.rb script that comes with the standard library uses 
Kernel#set_trace_func API. This way it is possible to implement
the debugger in pure Ruby, but has a negative effect on the speed 
of your program execution. For each trace call Ruby interpreter 
creates a Binding object, even though it is not being used most
of the time. ruby-debug library moves most of the functionality 
of debug.rb to a native extension, this way significantly improving
the execution of your program.
