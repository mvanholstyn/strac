=== Before releasing 1.1.0:

== Test/Unit integration

As of 2698:

  $ ruby examples/spec_and_test_together.rb 
  Loaded suite examples/spec_and_test_together
  Started
  .
  Finished in 0.000236 seconds.

  1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
  .

  Finished in 0.011123 seconds

  1 example, 0 failures  

That works only if you use ruby (not the spec command) and if the requires go in this order:

  require 'spec'
  require 'test/unit'
  
We need to get it to where it works like that regardless of whether you use the ruby or spec commands
and regardless of the load order.  

== What's happening as of 2698:

If you reverse the requires you get this:

  $ ruby examples/spec_and_test_together.rb 
  .

  Finished in 0.011724 seconds

  1 example, 0 failures

If you use the spec command you get this regardless of the order of the requires (because
rspec gets loaded first regardless):

  $ ruby bin/spec examples/spec_and_test_together.rb 
  .

  Finished in 0.006246 seconds

  1 example, 0 failures


  Finished in 8.0e-06 seconds

  0 examples, 0 failures

So in this case, there is no test/unit output and rspec's output is printed a second time but showing 0 examples.
