Story: autogenerated docstrings

  As an RSpec user
  I want examples to generate their own names
  So that I can reduce duplication between example names and example code

  Scenario: run with ruby
    Given the file ../../examples/pure/autogenerated_docstrings_example.rb

    When I run it with the ruby interpreter -fs

    Then the stdout should match /should equal 5/
    And the stdout should match /should be < 5/
    And the stdout should match /should include "a"/
    And the stdout should match /should respond to #size/

    Scenario: run with spec
      Given the file ../../examples/pure/autogenerated_docstrings_example.rb

      When I run it with the spec script -fs

      Then the stdout should match /should equal 5/
      And the stdout should match /should be < 5/
      And the stdout should match /should include "a"/
      And the stdout should match /should respond to #size/
