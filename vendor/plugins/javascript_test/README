=JavaScript testing plugin

This plugin provides the script.aculo.us JavaScript unit testing framework
in a way that integrates with Rails applications.

==Usage

Use the provided generator to built a skeleton for your JavaScript test.
The built-in rake task can then be used to automatically run the unit tests
in various installed browsers (supported are Firefox on IE/Mac/Linux, 
Safari on Mac, Konqueror on Linux).

Note that due to the built-in webrick, you don't have to change anything
about your app, just add tests. :)

==Example

Generate a JavaScript test skeleton for your public/javascripts/foo.js file:

  script/generate javascript_test foo

Run the unit tests (an "assertTruth" dummy test is provided,
so you should see "SUCCESS" messages), and see the automagically 
controlled browsers in action:

  rake test:javascripts
  
You have to manually close the browser window(s) afterwards.

You can also run the test manually, by symlinking the assets directory.
In your Rails application root, run:

  ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/javascript_test/assets/ test/javascript/assets
  
You then can just open the individual .html test files in your browser.

All in all, unittest.js is closely modelled on Test::Unit and there's 
also experimental support for RSpec-style BDD testing. You can find lots 
of examples in both the Prototype and script.aculo.us SVN repositories.

You'll find more info on how to write tests on the script.aculo.us wiki:
http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/UnitTesting.
The documentation there is not really complete, so feel free to help out.
