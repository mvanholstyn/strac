=> release management
- why does gem rdoc include all source files? what about other package types?
- why does zip include Rakefile? what about other package types?
- tag releases in repos
- trac?

=> restrict partial mocks to existing public methods?
- investigate where/why check for existence of stubbed method has gone.
- allow stubbing of private/protected methods? - force_stub?
- allow specification of class to be mocked, so we can check for existence of methods

=> bugs
- assertion count is not incremented for missing expectation errors

=> multiple expectations for same method
- fail fast if expectation count exceeded during test...? c.f. JMock?

=> reduce footprint of mocha in terms of visible methods
- do away with __is_a__ method if possible - Proc param may no longer be needed
- add similar test to test_should_be_able_to_mock_standard_object_methods for partial mocks - rename non-public method with underscores e.g. mocha, reset_mocha, stubba_method, stubba_object, etc.
- reduce number of methods added to Object, Class etc to bare minimum
- reduce number of methods excluded from undef in Mock (maybe use BlankSlate as mocha parent class to allow mocking of standard object methods?)
- perhaps only add methods to particular class at point where expects or stubs gets called
- provide some means to un-stubba an object - ideally should restore any methods with same names as stubba methods c.f. dealing with expectations for methods called :expects, :stubs, etc.
- use Object#inspect(:mocha) or Object#__inspect__ instead of Object#mocha_inspect?

=> improve design
- use builder object c.f. JMock
- possibly simplify by making mock the same as a partial mock of Object
- provide test::unit agnostic api - mockery/context type objects on which the user must call setup/teardown?
- allow stubs/expects methods to accept method names as strings and symbols to retain similarity to define_method() et al

=> documentation
- read and improve tutorial emailed by user

=> naming
- default mock names to mock1, mock2, etc or something similar
- stubba mocks should named according to parent stubbee

=> improve tests
- use real activerecord as svn external to for testing instead of active_record_test_case
- test for setting expectations on class methods (and instance methods?) from within TestCase#setup

=> possible extra functionality
- more jmock style stuff - e.g. labels/required order, more sophisticated param matching?
- maybe allow unstubbing of a specific method from within a test...?
- oomatron type ideas
- should all instances share expectations for any_instance or should each instance have their own - in which case how do we provide access to the instances
