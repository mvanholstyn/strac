== About
CodeRay is a Ruby library for syntax highlighting.

Syntax highlighting means: You put your code in, and you get it back colored;
Keywords, strings, floats, comments - all in different colors.
And with line numbers.

*Syntax* *Highlighting*...
* makes code easier to read and maintain
* lets you detect syntax errors faster
* helps you to understand the syntax of a language
* looks nice
* is what everybody should have on their website
* solves all your problems and makes the girls run after you

== Installation

You need RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126].

 % gem install coderay

Since CodeRay is still in beta stage, nightly buildy may be useful:

 % gem install coderay -rs rd.cYcnus.de/coderay


=== Dependencies

CodeRay needs Ruby 1.8 and the strscan[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/strscan/rdoc/index.htm] library
(part of the standard library.)  It should also run with Ruby 1.9 and yarv.


== Example Usage
(Forgive me, but this is not highlighted.)

 require 'coderay'
 
 tokens = CodeRay.scan "puts 'Hello, world!'", :ruby
 page = tokens.html :line_numbers => :inline, :wrap => :page
 puts page

== Credits

=== Special Thanks to

* licenser (Heinz N. Gies) for ending my QBasic career, inventing the Coder project and the input/output plugin system.
  CodeRay would not exist without him.

=== Thanks to

* Caleb Clausen for writing RubyLexer (see
  http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubylexer) and lots of very interesting mail
  traffic
* birkenfeld (Georg Brandl) and mitsuhiku (Arnim Ronacher) for PyKleur. You
  guys rock!
* Jamis Buck for writing Syntax (see http://rubyforge.org/projects/syntax)
  I got some useful ideas from it.
* Doug Kearns and everyone else who worked on ruby.vim - it not only helped me
  coding CodeRay, but also gave me a wonderful target to reach for the Ruby
  scanner.
* everyone who used CodeBB on http://www.rubyforen.de and
  http://www.infhu.de/mx
* iGEL, magichisoka, manveru, WoN·Do and everyone I forgot from rubyforen.de
* Daniel and Dethix from ruby-mine.de
* Dookie (who is no longer with us...) and Leonidas from
  http://www.python-forum.de
* matz and all Ruby gods and gurus
* The inventors of: the computer, the internet, the true color display, HTML &
  CSS, VIM, RUBY, pizza, microwaves, guitars, scouting, programming, anime, 
  manga, coke and green ice tea.

Where would we be without all those people?

* As you can see, CodeRay was created under heavy use of *free* software.
* So CodeRay is also *free*.
* If you use CodeRay to create software, think about making this software *free*, too.
* Thanks :)
