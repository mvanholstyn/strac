== Version 0.4.0

This release of XForge completely reorganises classes and modules into a more
coherent API for accessing projects' issue trackers, scms and scm browsers. The toplevel
namespace is now MetaProject.

The new ScmWeb class now supports *any* scm browser through its flexible
configuration options.

In order to easily gather information from various hosting services, XForge comes with a ProjectAnalyzer
class, which given an scm browser URL will discover the associated issue tracker, preconfigured scm_web,
project home page and of course, an RSCM object.

Supported project sources:
- RubyForge.org
- SourceForge.org
- Codehaus.org
- Trac projects

Supported issue trackers:
- RubyForge.org
- SourceForge.org
- JIRA
- Trac projects

Supported SCM browsers:
- *Any* scm browser through its flexible configuration options.

Supported SCMs:
- Any SCM implemented in the <a href="http://rscm.rubyforge.org/">RSCM</a> project.

own Rakefile for details.
