Changelog:

27.2. deprecate has_many_polymorphs_cache_classes= option, because it doesn't really work. use config.cache_classes= instead to cache all reloadable items
27.1. dispatcher.to_prepare didn't fire in the console; now using a config.after_initialize wrapper instead
27. dependency injection framework elimates having to care about load order
26. make the logger act sane for the gem version
25.2. allow :skip_duplicates on double relationships
25.1. renamed :ignore_duplicates to :skip_duplicates to better express its non-passive behavior, made sure not to load target set on push unless necessary
25. activerecord compatibility branch becomes trunk. extra options now supported for double polymorphism; conditions nulled-out and propogated to child relationships; more tests; new :ignore_duplicates option on macro can be set to false if you want << to try to push duplicate associations
24.1. code split into multiple files. tests added for pluralization check. rails 1.1.6 no longer officially supported.
24. unlimited mixed class association extensions for both single and double targets and joins
