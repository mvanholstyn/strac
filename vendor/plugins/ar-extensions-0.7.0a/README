ActiveRecord::Optimizations 0.0.2
---------------------------------
July 20th, 11:27pm, Zach Dennis

This includes some of the optimizations for the ActiveRecord::Base. This release only supports the MysqlAdapter, although other adapters will be supported in upcoming releases.

HOW-TO USAGE
------------
Require the two files in the lib/ directory and then create records using:
  Model.create array_of_hashes

Example:
  class LogEntry < ActiveRecord::Base ; end
  LogEntry.import [ { :log_entry_name=>"Name" }, {:log_entry_name=>"Name2"}, ... ], :optimize=>true

Using the optimized create method will return the number of inserts performed, rather then an array of LogEntry objects. This currently skips model validation.


CHANGELOG
----------
0.0.2
 - add some documentation to the updated methods for ActiveRecord and MysqlAdapter
 - renamed the create optimizatin to import. Multi-value inserts can be obtained using ActiveRecord::Base.import
0.0.1
 - introduced updates to ActiveRecord::Base.create to support multi-value inserts


UPCOMING
----------
 - model validation on imports
 - postgresql support for imports
 - ability to use regular expressions for db searches
 - ability to use db functions
 - temporary table support
 - memory table support
 - complex update with on duplicate key update support
