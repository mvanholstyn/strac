	* Added ActiveRecord::Base::AbstractAdapter#synchronize method which allows a mass re-synchronization of ActiveRecord instances. This is similar to ActiveRecord::Base#reload except that it works on multiple instances at a time rather then one. This sends one query for all instances rather then 1 per instance reloaded.

	* Fixed bug with URI encoded strings with a workaround in the Comparison extension. ActiveRecord needs to be fixed to not use the String#%  method so strings that do contains percentage signs will not fail

	* Applied patch from Grant Goodale to allow the Like extension to support arrays when using the '_contains' suffix

	* Made a .gemspec for ar-extensions

2007-01-24  zdennis  <zdennis@mktec.com>

	* Added dependency for Mocha 0.4.0 or higher for testing

2007-01-09  zdennis  <zdennis@aries>

	* Added support for embedded to_csv includes

2007-01-07  zdennis  <zdennis@aries>

	* Added fix to init.rb to only load CSV functionality if FasterCSV
	is available, otherwise print a message to STDERR and continue.

	* Added fix to tests/boot.rb which solves fixture_path issues in
	ActiveRecord 1.14.4 and earlier. The fix is included Rails trunk
	and will be available in Rails 1.2.

2007-01-05  zdennis  <zdennis@aries>

	* Added ActiveRecord::Extensions::VERSION module which has the following constants: MAJOR, MINOR, REVISION

	* Running rake tests are now smart enough to rebuild the database if they are required based on schema_info table.

	* Added schema_info table for test database schemas. 

2006-12-29  zdennis  <zdennis@aries>

	* Updated the Rakefile to run an external ruby process when running test files rather then in the same ruby process that runs the Rakefile

	* Updated the directory structure of lib/ to solve namespace issues.

2006-12-22  Zach Dennis  <zdennis@silver.dennis.network>

	* Added rake tasks for sqlite and sqlite3 databases

	* Added "does_not_match" as a suffix to better finders when working with Regular Expressions

	* Added "not_between" suffix to better finders when working with Ranges

2006-12-17  zdennis  <zdennis@aries>

	* Added :only and :except options to to_csv method. Forcing
	compatibility with http://blog.integralimpressions.com/articles/2006/09/01/tocsv-plugin

	* Changed to_csv option :headers take a boolean rather then an
	array of column names.

	* Added rake task db:prepare_<adapter_name> to build test
	database. 

2006-12-16  Zach Dennis  <zdennis@silver.dennis.network>

	* Added more tests for better finder support

	* Added to_csv support for Arrays returned by ActiveRecord::Base.find

	* Refactored ActiveRecord::Extensions::Registry to use an Array instead of hash

2006-12-06  Zach Dennis  <zdennis@silver.dennis.network>

	* PostgreSQL has tested support for everything MySQL has except for Full Text Searching. This is not implemented.

	* Refactored how import and full text searching implementation is handled, this is largely handled by duck typing certain method calls. 

	* Added generic import support for any adapter that doesn't support multi-value insert statements. This provides generic support which is guaranteed to be no slower then ActiveRecord#create. 

2006-11-23  Zach Dennis  <zdennis@silver.dennis.network>

	* Added finder support for PostgreSQL including Regexp Searching. (No full text searching though)

2006-11-20  Zach Dennis  <zach.dennis@gmail.com>

	* Refactored core finder components out into ActiveRecord extensions

	* Duck typing support for any object that is passed in to a conditions hash. ie: MyModel.find( :all, :conditions=>{ :name=>NameSearchObject.new } )

	* Duck typing support for any object that is passed in as a condition. ie: MyModel.find( :all, :conditions=>SearchObject.new )
